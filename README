# Heimdall Image Handler

The Image Handler is a ROS node that grabs images from a USB camera and saves
them. It also manages the rate of grabbing and saving and adjusts this to the
amount of activity, and can switch between a RGB and a IR image based on
brightness to make sure a visible image is always available.
